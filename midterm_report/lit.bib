abstract = {Long-span bridge traffic loading is governed by congestion. Although congestion can take various forms, most previous studies consider only a queue of vehicles. In this paper, traffic micro-simulation is used to generate several congested traffic scenarios on a two-lane same-direction roadway passing over two long-span bridges. To this end, an acknowledged car-following model is coupled with a lane-changing model. Different traffic compositions and several congestion patterns are analysed in relation to their traffic features and influence on bridge loading. It is found that: (a) slow-moving traffic may be as critical as the full-stop condition, depending on the span length; (b) critical long in-lane truck platoons form mainly at moderate inflows, typically occurring outside of rush hours; (c) the truck distribution between lanes has a limited effect on the total loading; (d) the presence of cars has a strong indirect influence on loading through their interaction with trucks. The methodology and the findings have relevance for computing a more accurate traffic loading for long-span bridges.}

    abstract = { A general model (minimizing overall braking induced by lane change, MOBIL) is proposed to derive lane-changing rules for discretionary and mandatory lane changes for a wide class of car-following models. Both the utility of a given lane and the risk associated with lane changes are determined in terms of longitudinal accelerations calculated with microscopic traffic models. This determination allows for the formulation of compact and general safety and incentive criteria for both symmetric and asymmetric passing rules. Moreover, anticipative elements and the crucial influence of velocity differences of these car-following models are automatically transferred to the lane-changing rules. Although the safety criterion prevents critical lane changes and collisions, the incentive criterion takes into account the advantages and disadvantages of other drivers associated with a lane change via the “politeness factor.” The parameter allows one to vary the motivation for lane changing from purely egoistic to more cooperative driving behavior. This novel feature allows one first to prevent lane changes for a marginal advantage if they obstruct other drivers and second to let an aggressive driver induce the lane change of a slower driver ahead in order to no longer be obstructed. This phenomenon is common for asymmetric passing rules with a dedicated lane for passing. The model is applied to traffic simulations of cars and trucks with the intelligent driver model as the underlying car-following model. An open system with an on-ramp is studied, and the resulting lane-changing rate is investigated as a function of the spatial coordinate as well as a function of traffic density. }

ABSTRACT = {The platform of a microscopic traffic simulation provides an opportunity to study the driving behavior of vehicles on a roadway system. Compared to traditional conventional cars with human drivers, the car-following behaviors of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) would be quite different and hence require additional modeling efforts. This paper presents a thorough review of the literature on the car-following models used in prevalent micro-simulation tools for vehicles with both human and robot drivers. Specifically, the car-following logics such as the Wiedemann model and adaptive cruise control technology were reviewed based on the vehicle’s dynamic behavior and driving environments. In addition, some of the more recent “AV-ready (autonomous vehicles ready) tools” in micro-simulation platforms are also discussed in this paper.},
