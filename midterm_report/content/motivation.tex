\section{Goal of this project}
\label{sec:goal}

The main goal of this project is to analyze how the traffic rules about overtaking affect the traffic. One candidate
for comparison is the driving law as it is implemented in many European countries, which are summed up in the United
Nations Vienna convention about road traffic \cite{vienna-treaty}. Here a driver is obligated to stay as far from the
center of the road when he is not overtaking another driver and shall move towards the center when he is overtaking.
Opposed to this there are countries, like some US states, where a driver is free to choose the lane for any maneuver.
What this means, is that a car can be legally passed on both sites.
