abstract = {Determining the speed limit of road transport systems has a significant role in the speed management of vehicles. In most cases, setting a speed limit is considered as a trade-off between reducing travel time on one hand and reducing road accidents on the other, and the two factors of vehicle fuel consumption and emission rate of air pollutants have been neglected. This paper aims to evaluate optimal speed limits in traffic networks in a way that economized societal costs are incurred. In this study, experimental and field data as well as data from simulations are used to determine how speed is related to the emission of pollutants, fuel consumption, travel time, and the number of accidents. This paper also proposes a simple model to calculate the societal costs of travel and relate them to speed. As a case study, using emission test results on cars manufactured domestically and by simulating the suburban traffic flow by Aimsun software, the total societal costs of the Shiraz-Marvdasht motorway, which is one of the most traversed routes in Iran, have been estimated. The results of the study show that from a societal perspective, the optimal speed would be 73km/h, and from a road user perspective, it would be 82km/h (in 2011, the average speed of the passing vehicles on that motorway was 82km/h). The experiments in this paper were run on three different vehicles with different types of fuel. In a comparative study, the results show that the calculated speed limit is lower than the optimal speed limits in Sweden, Norway, and Australia.}
