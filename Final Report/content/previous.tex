\section{Previous work}
\label{sec:previous_work}
In this report I will cover the previous work only briefly since it has been covered in my midterm report already.
Firstly I will explain the Intelligent Driver Model by Treiber et al. In his work a car following model has been derived
which mimics a driver who is well aware of his surrounding. Afterwards I will give an overview over the lane changing
decision algorithm devoleoped by Kersting et al.
