abstract = { A general model (minimizing overall braking induced by lane change, MOBIL) is proposed to derive lane-changing rules for discretionary and mandatory lane changes for a wide class of car-following models. Both the utility of a given lane and the risk associated with lane changes are determined in terms of longitudinal accelerations calculated with microscopic traffic models. This determination allows for the formulation of compact and general safety and incentive criteria for both symmetric and asymmetric passing rules. Moreover, anticipative elements and the crucial influence of velocity differences of these car-following models are automatically transferred to the lane-changing rules. Although the safety criterion prevents critical lane changes and collisions, the incentive criterion takes into account the advantages and disadvantages of other drivers associated with a lane change via the “politeness factor.” The parameter allows one to vary the motivation for lane changing from purely egoistic to more cooperative driving behavior. This novel feature allows one first to prevent lane changes for a marginal advantage if they obstruct other drivers and second to let an aggressive driver induce the lane change of a slower driver ahead in order to no longer be obstructed. This phenomenon is common for asymmetric passing rules with a dedicated lane for passing. The model is applied to traffic simulations of cars and trucks with the intelligent driver model as the underlying car-following model. An open system with an on-ramp is studied, and the resulting lane-changing rate is investigated as a function of the spatial coordinate as well as a function of traffic density. },

abstract = {Determining the speed limit of road transport systems has a significant role in the speed management of vehicles. In most cases, setting a speed limit is considered as a trade-off between reducing travel time on one hand and reducing road accidents on the other, and the two factors of vehicle fuel consumption and emission rate of air pollutants have been neglected. This paper aims to evaluate optimal speed limits in traffic networks in a way that economized societal costs are incurred. In this study, experimental and field data as well as data from simulations are used to determine how speed is related to the emission of pollutants, fuel consumption, travel time, and the number of accidents. This paper also proposes a simple model to calculate the societal costs of travel and relate them to speed. As a case study, using emission test results on cars manufactured domestically and by simulating the suburban traffic flow by Aimsun software, the total societal costs of the Shiraz-Marvdasht motorway, which is one of the most traversed routes in Iran, have been estimated. The results of the study show that from a societal perspective, the optimal speed would be 73km/h, and from a road user perspective, it would be 82km/h (in 2011, the average speed of the passing vehicles on that motorway was 82km/h). The experiments in this paper were run on three different vehicles with different types of fuel. In a comparative study, the results show that the calculated speed limit is lower than the optimal speed limits in Sweden, Norway, and Australia.},
