# IntelligentDriver
The repository with the source code of my implementation of the intelligent driver model for a project for the Computational Physics class at Kaist. Most of the stuff can be built with `make <Target>` and uses `g++` and python with matplotlib for visualizations. 

Information about the implementation in C++ is in `include/README.md`
